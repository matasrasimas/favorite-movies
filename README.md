# Favorite Movies

A simple web application that allows you to create a list of your favorite movies.

## Tech Stack

### Frontend
- HTML
- CSS (SASS)
- TypeScript (React.ts)

### Backend
- Node.js (Nest.js)

## Getting Started

To run the app on your local machine, follow these steps:

1. Clone the repository (download app) to your local machine.
2. Open the terminal or command line, navigate to the 'backend' folder using the `cd` (change directory) command.
3. Execute the following command: `npm run json-server`. This command will start the local database on port 5000. Keep this terminal/command prompt open.
4. Open another terminal or command prompt (do not close the previous terminal/command prompt), navigate to the 'backend' folder using the `cd` command.
5. Execute the following command: `npm run start:dev`. This command will start the Nest.js server on port 3000. Keep this terminal/command prompt open.
6. Open another terminal or command prompt (do not close the window in which you ran the previous command), navigate to the 'frontend' folder.
7. Execute the following command: `npm run dev`. This command will start the React development server on port 4000. Keep this terminal/command prompt open.
8. Open a web browser of your choice and type in the URL: `localhost:4000`.
9. The app should now be running, and you can start adding your favorite movies to the list.

**Note:**
- Node.js is required to run this project. Ensure that you have Node.js installed on your machine before proceeding.
- Make sure to keep the three terminal/command prompt windows open while running the app locally. If you encounter any issues, double-check that the necessary dependencies are installed and that the ports specified are not in use by other applications on your machine.

## Usage

Once the app is running, you will need to create a new account. After that, you will be able to create your own list of favorite movies. You can also remove movies from the list.
